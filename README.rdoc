acts_as_solr plugin: multiple forks exist on GitHub, this extension was tested and developed against the mattmatt fork: http://github.com/mattmatt/acts_as_solr

solr: acts_as_solr comes with a pre configured version of Solr (1.3). It is recommended that you use that installation of Solr but if you prefer to run your own or to point to a installation running on a remote server, make sure you use the same schema.xml and solrconfig.xml settings.
